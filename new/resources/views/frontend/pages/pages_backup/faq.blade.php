                                                        earn more crypto while holding for long-term investments.
                                                        Interest is paid monthly and compounds. This significantly
                                                        increases the potential earnings of long-term account

                                                    <p>A loan from BlockFi enables you to use your cryptoassets as
                                                        collateral and receive USD to your bank account. Borrowing
